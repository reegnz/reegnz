### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a CLI hacker passionate about the terminal.

Tools I find essential for my work every day (totally incomplete with no particular order):

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for terminal emulation
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) + [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) + [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) + my favourite plugins
  - https://github.com/tpope - anything from this nobody
  - https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak
  - https://github.com/stsewd/gx-extended.vim
  - https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim
  - https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
  - https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips
  - https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter
  - see complete list of what I'm using in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/reegnz/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/plug.vim)
- I also use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) sometimes but ðŸ¤«
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to handle contextual things instead of me
- [exa](https://the.exa.website/) because ls is sooooo last millennium...
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for a bunch of my interactive needs
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and my [jq-zsh-plugin](https://github.com/reegnz/jq-zsh-plugin) for wrangling with JSON
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) + [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for finding things
- [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) + 
  [findutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/) + 
  [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/) because of course, duh!
- [gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/) + [gsed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) for the quick and dirty stuff
- [curl](https://curl.se/) because obviously, DUUUH!
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for those pretty diffs! ðŸ¤©

Languages I prefer to work with (in no particular order):
