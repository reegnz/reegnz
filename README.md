### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a CLI hacker passionate about the terminal.

Tools I find essential at my work every day (totally incomplete with no particular order):

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for terminal emulation
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) + [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) + [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) + [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) + some of my favourite plugins
  - see my current config in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/reegnz/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim-lazyvim/.config/nvim/)
- I also use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) sometimes but ðŸ¤«
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and my [jq-zsh-plugin](https://github.com/reegnz/jq-zsh-plugin) for wrangling with JSON
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for a bunch of my interactive needs
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to handle contextual things instead of me
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) because ls is sooooo last millennium...
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) + [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for finding things
- [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) +
  [findutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/) +
  [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/) because of course, duh!
- [gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/) + [gsed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) for the quick and dirty stuff
- [curl](https://curl.se/) because obviously, DUUUH!
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for those pretty diffs! ðŸ¤©

Languages I prefer to work with (in no particular order):

- [go](https://golang.org/)
- [lua](https://www.lua.org/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [bash](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

I'm working a lot with [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
and [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/).
